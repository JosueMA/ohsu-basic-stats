## Overview

Due by beginning of class Tuesday July 17th (2:30pm).

The goal is to explore a new-to-you dataset. In particular, to begin to establish a workflow for data frames or “tibbles”. You will use `dplyr` and `ggplot2` to do some description and visualization. You may also wish to use the `janitor` package to make `tabyl`s, and some of the accompanying `adorn` functions.

Your homework should serve as your own personal cheatsheet in the future for things to do with a new dataset. Give yourself the cheatsheet you deserve! You'll submit your work as an html file knit from your `.Rmd` file. Remember:

- `dplyr` should be your data manipulation tool
- `ggplot2` should be your visualization tool

You will explore the `reprohealth` dataset, which is distributed as an R package from [my personal GitHub](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html). 

Install it, and remember to use this code only in your R console, not in a script or .Rmd file:

``` r
install.packages("remotes") # install the remotes package
library(remotes) # load remotes package so you can install from github
install_github("apreshill/reprohealth") # install the package
```

Then at the top of your lab, copy and paste this code:

``` r
library(reprohealth) # load the package
wb_reprohealth # call the data
```

## Logistics

If you want to do something comparable but different, i.e. swap one quantitative variable for another, be my guest! If you are feeling inspired and curious, then we’re doing this right. Go for it.

Relax about the following things:

- Tidying/reshaping is NOT your assignment. Many of your tables will be awkwardly shaped in the report. That’s OK.
- Table beauty is not a big deal. Simply printing to “screen” is fine. 
- For all things, graphical and tabular, if you’re dissatisfied with a result, discuss the problem, what you’ve tried and move on (remember my 30-minute rule).

## Exploring the data

You should answer the following questions by using R:

* How many variables/columns?
* How many rows/observations?
* Complete this sentence: "There is one row per..."


### Task menu

* Get the maximum and minimum of children per woman for all continents.

* Look at the spread of children per woman across countries within the continents.

* Compute a trimmed mean of maternal mortality for different years. Or a weighted mean, weighting by population. Just try something other than the plain vanilla mean.

* How does maternal mortality vary across different continents?

* Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low maternal mortality over time by continent: Compute some measure of worldwide maternal mortality - you decide - a mean or median or some other quantile or perhaps your current age. Then determine how many countries on each continent have a maternal mortality rate less than this benchmark, for each year.

* Find countries with interesting stories. Open-ended and, therefore, hard. Promising but unsuccessful attempts are encouraged. This will generate interesting questions to follow up on in class.

* Make up your own! Between the `dplyr` coverage in class and the list above, you get the idea.

### Companion graphs

For each table, make sure to include a relevant figure. One tip for starting is to draw out on paper what you want your x- and y-axis to be first and what your `geom` is; that is, start by drawing the plot you want `ggplot` to give you. 

Your figure does not have to depict every last number from the data aggregation result. Use your judgement. It just needs to complement the table, add context, and allow for some sanity checking both ways.

Notice which figures are easy/hard to make, which data formats make better inputs for plotting functions vs. for human-friendly tables.


## Report your process

You’re encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. Give credit to your sources, whether it’s a blog post, a fellow student, an online tutorial, etc.

## Grading

__Our general grading guidelines__

_Check minus:_ Didn't tackle at least 3 tasks. Or didn't make companion graphs. Or didn't interpret anything but left it all to the "reader". Or more than one technical problem that is relatively easy to fix. It's hard to find the analyst or the narrative in all this R output.

_Check:_ Hits all the elements in all four sections. No obvious mistakes. Pleasant to read. No head scratchers. Solid and complete.

_Check plus:_ Exceeded the requirements in more than one section. Or developed novel ways to do things or ways of looking at a task that were indeed interesting and "worked". Impressive use and clear understanding of both what went into R in terms of code and what R spit back out. Impeccable organization and presentation in the report.
