## Safe-stats


> *"Statisticians have a tendency to advocate statistical abstinence: you should only practice statistics if you’re in a long-term relationship with a statistician (Wickham 2015). But abstinence-based education rarely works. People see their friends using statistics and having a great time, and there simply aren’t enough statisticians to go around. As a field, we need to teach safe-stats, not just statistical abstinence."*

    - you didn’t know,
    - you have heard before but can’t define or explain to other people, or
    - you can’t actually do (i.e., if you had their data, could you replicate?)
